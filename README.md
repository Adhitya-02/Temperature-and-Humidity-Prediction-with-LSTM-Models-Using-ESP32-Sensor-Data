# Temperature and Humidity Prediction with LSTM Models Using ESP32 Sensor Data

## Overview

This project leverages ESP32 sensor data to predict temperature and humidity trends with LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) models. The ESP32 captures real-time environmental data, streaming it to a Python script via Visual Studio Code. The LSTM models analyze the data, providing accurate predictions for temperature and humidity variations.

## Key Features

- **ESP32 Integration:** Utilize the power of ESP32 to capture and transmit sensor data.
- **LSTM Models:** Implement advanced LSTM models for precise temperature and humidity predictions.
- **Real-time Streaming:** Stream real-time data to a Python script through Visual Studio Code for immediate analysis.
- **Seamless Integration:** Achieve seamless integration of sensor technology and machine learning for enhanced climate monitoring.

## Getting Started

1. **Install Dependencies:** Ensure all required dependencies, including ESP32 libraries and Python packages, are installed.
2. **Upload Code to ESP32:** Upload the provided code to your ESP32 device for capturing sensor data.
3. **Run Python Script:** Execute the Python script in Visual Studio Code to process the streamed data with LSTM models.
4. **View Predictions:** Access accurate temperature and humidity predictions for informed climate monitoring.
